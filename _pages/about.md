Gengmo Zhou is currently a Ph.D. student under the supervision of Prof. [Zhewei Wei](https://gsai.ruc.edu.cn/zhewei) at the [Gaoling School of Artificial Intelligence](http://ai.ruc.edu.cn/), [Renmin University of China](https://www.ruc.edu.cn/), where he also completed his undergraduate studies at the [School of Information](http://info.ruc.edu.cn/). In addition to his academic pursuits, Gengmo is also gaining practical experience through an internship at [DP Technology](https://www.dp.tech/). His research interests lie in AI4science, with a special focus on the application of AI in pharmaceuticals. Recently, he has been engaged in the study of 3D molecule modeling, aiming to extend its application to various downstream tasks.
